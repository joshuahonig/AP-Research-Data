# Appendices

Some appendices included an amount of data that could not feasibly fit in to a text document, so the data is stored here. Click "Clone or Download" and then "Download ZIP" to download all of the data in this repository.

## Note about viewing graphs:

On a desktop computer, only a portion of the graphs may show. To get the full graph, click the grey "Download" button in the top right.

## Appendix C

There is a folder for each politician. The folders contain all graphs generated for that politician. 

## Appendix D

There is a folder for each cohort. The folders contain all graphs generated for that cohort.

## Appendix E

To download all of the data for use in a spreadsheet editor, open "CSV" and download "Appendix E.csv". If you would just like to view Appendix E, open the "PDF" folder. The file is split in to four parts, each of which are in this folder.
